To build this code with CMake follow these steps:

1) log into a Fermilab gpvm node of your choice
2) establish a ups development environment by doing
   source /cvmfs/nova.opensciencegrid.org/externals/setups
3) create a development area, ie
   mkdir numi-beam-sim-g4numi-development; cd numi-beam-sim-g4numi-development
4) check out the code with git, ie
   git clone ssh://p-numi-beam-sim@cdcvs.fnal.gov/cvs/projects/numi-beam-sim-g4numi
5) move the source code to a better named directory
   mv numi-beam-sim-g4numi srcs
6) create a build directory that is *separate* from the source code
   mkdir build_numi-beam-sim-g4numi; cd build_numi-beam-sim-g4numi
7) setup up the build environment
   source ../srcs/ups/setup_for_development -<d,p> [d for debug, p for profile]
8) [optional] setup ninja as the build generator
   setup ninja v1_8_2
9) create the build files (buildtool -h prints help for buildtool, part of the cetbuildtools package)
   buildtool --generator ninja
10) create a local ups product if desired
   cd ../
   mkdir local_products
   cd build_numi-beam-sim-g4numi
   buildtool -i -I ../local_products --generator ninja
11) create a tarball of the ups product for general users
   buildtool -p --generator ninja
12) put the tarball in cvmfs - see your experiment's cvmfs librarian
