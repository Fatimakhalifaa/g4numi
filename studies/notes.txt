-  NumiKelvinFunctions.hh
-  NumiKelvinFunctions.cc
   
   Set of functions to calculate Kelvin Functions. We were using this to
   get an analytical solution for the horn current distribution. The 
   solution that we implement was wrong (Minerva doc 9528) but we keep 
   here these functions that can be useful in the future.
